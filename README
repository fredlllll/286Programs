i own an old tandon x86 compatible computer with an intel286 (equivalent??) cpu @10MHz with 1 MB ram. it has a 16 color gpu with an accompanying monitor. monitor and gpu are connected with a db9 vga plug

software in this repo is written to run on said computer.

current goal is to save the hdd contents. the computer doesnt boot anymore, most likely because of bitrot, and i want to save what is on its 65MB hdd
